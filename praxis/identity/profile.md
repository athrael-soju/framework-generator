## Positioning

**Who I help:** Organizations in Financial Services, Energy, Legal, and Academia seeking to implement production-ready AI systems.

**Problem solved:** Bridging the gap between AI research and production deployment—turning promising AI capabilities into shipped systems with measurable outcomes.

**Differentiation:**
- Published researcher with practical production focus (not academic-only)
- Multimodal expertise spanning text, vision, and audio RAG
- Ambassador for Qdrant (vector DB) and Vercel (deployment)—deep ecosystem knowledge
- 10+ years cross-sector experience with enterprise constraints

## Expertise

**Primary:**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (multimodal: text, vision, audio)
- Vision-language systems and document understanding
- AI agents and agentic architectures
- Knowledge graphs and GraphRAG

**Secondary:**
- Enterprise AI strategy and architecture
- Machine vision and computer vision
- Conversational AI
- MLOps and production deployment

**Tools & Platforms:**
- Vector databases: Qdrant
- Frameworks: Next.js, Python ML stack
- Infrastructure: Vercel, cloud platforms
- Methods: SAFe 6 certified

## Experience

**Current:** R&D Technical AI Lead, CGI Scotland & Northern Ireland (March 2025–present)

**Background:**
- 10+ years cross-sector technology consulting
- Industries: Financial Services, Energy, Legal, Academia
- Education: DePaul University (Graduate Assistantship recipient)

**Notable Projects:**
- Snappy: Vision-language system for region-level document retrieval (76 GitHub stars)
- Vision RAG template (ColPali + Qdrant)
- GraphRAG implementation (Neo4j + Qdrant)
- Video annotation pipeline (RF-DETR + BLIP-2)

**Publications:**
- "Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation" (2025)
- ICALEPCS proceedings on telescope infrastructure monitoring (2023)

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AI Architecture | Design production-ready AI system architectures aligned with business outcomes |
| RAG Implementation | Build retrieval-augmented generation systems across text, vision, and audio modalities |
| Vision AI | Develop document understanding and visual search capabilities |
| AI Agents | Design and implement agentic systems and workflows |
| Strategy & Advisory | Advise on AI roadmaps, tool selection, and build-vs-buy decisions |

**Engagement models:** Hourly, day rate, fixed-price projects, retainer

## Ideal Client

**Characteristics:**
- Seeks production AI, not perpetual R&D
- Has defined business outcomes and success metrics
- Technical stakeholder available for collaboration
- Budget aligned with senior expertise ($200+/hour range)

**Buying signals:**
- Recent funding or strategic AI initiative announced
- Hiring for AI roles but struggling to fill
- Failed or stalled AI project needing rescue
- Compliance/regulatory pressure requiring AI documentation capabilities

**Red flags:**
- No clear outcomes defined
- Legacy system maintenance disguised as AI work
- Budget shopping or rate pressure below floor
- "We need it yesterday" without scope flexibility

## Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Rate floor | $200/hour or $1,000/day minimum |
| Engagement types | Hourly, day rate, fixed-price, retainer |
| Availability | Project-based (parallel to CGI role) |
| Location | Remote-only; no geographic restrictions |
| Timezone | UK-based; flexible for async collaboration |

**Deal-breakers:**
- Projects without clear outcomes
- Legacy system maintenance work
- Scope creep without renegotiation
