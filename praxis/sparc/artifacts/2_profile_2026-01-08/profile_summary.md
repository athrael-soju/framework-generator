- Lead with RAG accuracy optimization
- Reference Qdrant expertise (they likely use vector DB)
- Acknowledge their 94% benchmark; offer path to higher

### Priority 2: Filevine

**Rationale:** Larger opportunity but longer sales cycle. Multiple AI products suggest varied needs. Vision document processing (MedCron) is strong fit.

**Approach:**
- Position as specialized expertise for specific capability
- Lead with vision-language document understanding
- Reference published research on document retrieval
- Target CTO (Jim Blake) or AI product leads
