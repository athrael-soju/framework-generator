---

## Fit Assessment

### Alignment with Identity Profile

| Criterion | Match |
|-----------|-------|
| Production AI focus | Strong — shipping product with real users |
| Defined outcomes | Strong — accuracy metrics, legal research |
| Technical stakeholder | Medium — CEO is technical but CTO departed |
| Budget | Medium — $28M raised, early stage |

### Service Opportunities

| Service | Relevance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| RAG Implementation | Very High | Core to their product; accuracy is their differentiator |
| AI Architecture | High | Post-CTO departure may need senior guidance |
| Vision AI | Medium | Document understanding for legal docs |
| Strategy Advisory | Medium | CEO has VC background, may value strategic input |

### Potential Engagement Angles

1. **RAG accuracy optimization** — Their 94% benchmark is good but not perfect; improvement directly impacts product value
2. **Technical leadership advisory** — CTO departure creates gap; fractional/advisory could fill
3. **Multimodal RAG expansion** — Legal documents often include images, tables, charts
4. **Hallucination reduction** — Core to their value prop; expertise directly applicable

### Unique Opportunity

CTO departure in June 2025 creates potential need for:
- Senior AI/ML advisory
- Architecture review
- Technical roadmap guidance

CEO's VC background suggests comfort with external expertise and advisory relationships.

## Data Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Recommended Action |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| Current CTO / technical leadership | High | LinkedIn search for recent hires |
| Specific RAG architecture details | Medium | Technical blog or conference talks |
| Product roadmap (post-CTO) | Medium | Monitor announcements |
| Team size breakdown (eng vs. other) | Low | LinkedIn company page review |
