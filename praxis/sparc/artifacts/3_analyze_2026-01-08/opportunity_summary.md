## Prioritized Opportunities

### Rank 1: Paxton AI — Technical Advisory

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Opportunity** | Fill CTO gap with AI architecture advisory |
| **Fit Score** | 9/10 |
| **Urgency** | High — CTO departed Jun 2025 |
| **Budget** | Medium — $28M funding |
| **Decision Speed** | Fast — 24-person company, CEO decides |
| **Competition** | Low — time-sensitive window |

**Why #1:**
- CTO departure creates immediate, specific need
- RAG accuracy is their core differentiator — directly aligned
- CEO has VC background, understands external expertise value
- Smaller org = faster decision, direct CEO access
- Lower competition for advisory role before they hire

**Recommended Service:**
- Fractional AI advisory / architecture review
- RAG optimization consulting
- Technical roadmap guidance

**Engagement Estimate:**
- Initial: 10-20 hours diagnostic
- Ongoing: Advisory retainer or project-based

### Rank 2: Filevine — Vision Document AI

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Opportunity** | Vision-language AI for document understanding |
| **Fit Score** | 8/10 |
| **Urgency** | Medium — growth mode, not crisis |
| **Budget** | Very High — $548M, $3B valuation |
| **Decision Speed** | Slower — large org, multiple stakeholders |
| **Competition** | Medium — internal AI team exists |

**Why #2:**
- Larger budget but slower process
- MedCron (medical records) and contract analysis are strong fits
- User complaints about search/performance create pain point
- Internal team may resist external help
- Two AI acquisitions suggest build-over-buy preference

**Recommended Service:**
- Vision RAG for complex document processing
- Search/retrieval optimization
- Potentially: Post-acquisition AI integration support

**Engagement Estimate:**
- Project-based: Specific capability development
- Larger scope but longer sales cycle
