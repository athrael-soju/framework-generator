## Paxton AI — If Tanguy Replies

### Likely Questions

**"What specifically did you notice about multimodal docs?"**

Response:
> Legal documents often embed tables, charts, and images that pure text RAG misses. Medical records, contracts with signature blocks, regulatory filings with charts. Your 94% is on text — curious if you've measured performance on visually complex docs. We've been working on patch-to-region relevance propagation that handles this.

**"Who else have you worked with?"**

Response:
> I've published research on spatially-grounded document retrieval (2025 paper). Ambassador for Qdrant — work with their enterprise customers on RAG optimization. Background includes 10+ years consulting across financial services, legal, energy. Currently R&D AI Lead at CGI, doing this as project-based work.

**"What would this cost?"**

Response:
> Depends on scope. For diagnostic/advisory — typically 10-20 hours to assess current architecture and identify optimization paths. Project work is scoped individually. Happy to discuss what makes sense after we understand the specific challenge.

**"We're hiring a new CTO — might not be the right time."**

Response:
> Makes sense. A fractional/advisory engagement could actually help bridge the gap — provide senior technical input while you search, and potentially help evaluate candidates' approaches. Or happy to reconnect once they're onboard.

### Key Talking Points

| Topic | Point |
|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | "94% is strong but not ceiling — edge cases, multimodal, adversarial queries all matter for enterprise trust" |
| Differentiation | "Published research on this specific problem (document retrieval accuracy)" |
| Fit | "Advisory/fractional fits your stage — senior input without full-time commitment" |
| Urgency | "The CTO gap is temporary — happy to help bridge or reconnect later" |

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We handle this internally" | "Great — happy to share what we've learned. Sometimes an outside perspective helps. No pressure." |
| "Budget is tight post-Series A" | "Advisory is lighter commitment than project work. Even a single architecture review can help prioritize." |
| "Not looking right now" | "No problem. Mind if I follow up in Q2 when you've got the team settled?" |

## Filevine — If Jonas/Brianna Replies

### Likely Questions

**"What's your approach to vision-language for legal docs?"**

Response:
> We use patch-to-region relevance propagation — treat document images as grids, compute relevance at the patch level, then aggregate to meaningful regions (tables, figures, text blocks). Published research on this in 2025. Works well for medical records with mixed text/imaging, contracts with signature blocks and stamps.

**"Have you worked with similar products?"**

Response:
> Background in enterprise AI — currently R&D Lead at CGI. Published on document retrieval accuracy. Ambassador for Qdrant, so deep in the vector DB ecosystem. Project-based consulting outside CGI role.

**"What would integration look like?"**

Response:
> Depends on your architecture. Typically: assess current pipeline, identify where vision-language would add value (likely MedChron edge cases), prototype integration, measure accuracy improvement. Happy to scope after understanding your stack.

**"We just acquired Pincites and Parrot — we're integrating those first."**

Response:
> Makes sense — those are big integrations. Sometimes a third-party architecture review helps spot consolidation opportunities. Or happy to reconnect once they're integrated and you're looking at next capabilities.

### Key Talking Points

| Topic | Point |
|-------|-------|
| MedChron | "15-20 hrs → automated is huge. Vision-language could push accuracy on edge cases (poor scans, mixed formats)" |
| LOIS | "Citation verification is smart pattern. RAG accuracy optimization is exactly what we do." |
| Scale | "Your 20M pages/day is serious scale. Performance optimization matters as much as accuracy." |
| Integration | "Post-acquisition is good time to consolidate AI architecture." |

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have internal ML team" | "Great team — saw Brianna/Jonas in the MedChron interview. Sometimes specialized expertise complements internal. Happy to share approaches either way." |
| "We're focused on integration" | "Understood. Ping me when you're ready for new capabilities. Following your progress." |
| "What's the ROI?" | "Users cite search and performance issues. Faster, more accurate retrieval = lawyer time savings. We can scope a pilot to measure." |

## General Response Guidelines

### If They're Interested

1. **Propose discovery call** — "Happy to do 30 min to understand your specific challenges"
2. **Share something valuable** — Offer to send relevant research or benchmarks
3. **Let them drive timeline** — "When works for you?" not "Let's schedule now"

### If They're Not Interested

1. **Thank them** — "Appreciate you taking the time"
2. **Leave door open** — "Happy to reconnect if priorities shift"
3. **Don't push** — One follow-up max, then move on

### If No Response (After 7 Days)

1. **One gentle follow-up** — Different angle or shorter message
2. **Then wait** — Move to nurture list
3. **Re-engage on signal** — New funding, product launch, hiring
