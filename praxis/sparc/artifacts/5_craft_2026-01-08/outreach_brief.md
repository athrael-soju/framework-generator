### Message (276 chars)

```
Saw Michael moved on to agents — congrats on the growth that made that possible. Your 94% benchmark is impressive. Curious if you're exploring multimodal docs or edge cases to push higher while scaling the team. Happy to swap notes if useful.
```

### Why This Works

- **Hook:** References CTO departure (demonstrates research)
- **Tone:** Positive framing ("congrats on growth")
- **Insight:** Multimodal/edge cases — specific, not generic
- **Ask:** "Swap notes" — low commitment, peer-to-peer

### Send Timing

- **When:** Weekday, 9-11am PT (Palo Alto time)
- **Why:** Professional hours, before email pile-up

### Expected Outcomes

| Outcome | Likelihood | Next Step |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Positive reply | 25% | Schedule call, send research |
| Question/curiosity | 15% | Answer, re-ask for call |
| Polite decline | 10% | Thank, offer to reconnect later |
| No response | 50% | Follow-up in 7 days |

Caught the MedChron update — automating medical chronologies from 15-20 hrs is a big deal. We've been working on vision-language approaches for complex documents (tables, images in text). Curious how you're handling multimodal edge cases.
```

- **Insight:** Vision-language expertise — relevant to their challenge
- **Tone:** Technical peer conversation
- **Ask:** Open question, not meeting request

### Send Timing

- **When:** Weekday, 10am-12pm MT (Salt Lake City time)
- **Why:** Mid-morning, professional context

### Expected Outcomes

| Outcome | Likelihood | Next Step |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Positive reply | 15% | Technical discussion, scope project |
| Question/curiosity | 15% | Answer, build relationship |
| Polite decline | 15% | Thank, stay connected |
| No response | 55% | Follow-up in 7 days |
