## Prospect 1: Paxton AI

### Decision-Maker Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Dr. Tanguy Chau |
| Title | CEO & Co-Founder |
| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/in/tanguychau |
| Background | MIT PhD, ex-VC (Formation 8, Mayfield), ex-McKinsey |
| Tenure | Founded 2023 |

**Recent Activity:**
- Podcast appearances on legal AI trust (PreVetted, Law School Toolbox)
- Posts about hiring and team growth
- Product-led growth advocate

**Key Context:**
- CTO Michael Ulin departed June 2025 for agent startup
- 94% accuracy on Stanford benchmark is core differentiator
- $22M Series A (Jan 2025), scaling phase

---

### Message Variant A: Signal-Based (CTO Departure)

```
Saw Michael moved on to agents — congrats on the growth that made that possible. Your 94% benchmark is impressive. Curious if you're exploring multimodal docs or edge cases to push higher while scaling the team. Happy to swap notes if useful.
```
**Characters:** 276

---

### Message Variant B: Content-Based (Accuracy Focus)

```
Your 94% on the Stanford hallucination benchmark stands out. I've been researching accuracy optimization in RAG systems — published on spatially-grounded document retrieval. Curious what's on your roadmap for edge cases. Quick chat?
```
**Characters:** 248

---

### Message Variant C: Technical-Direct

```
Working on multimodal RAG for legal docs — vision + text retrieval for contracts, filings with embedded tables/images. Your accuracy focus aligns. Would love to compare approaches if you have 15 min.
```
**Characters:** 212

---

### Recommended: Variant A

**Why:** References specific signal (CTO departure) demonstrating research depth. Tactful framing ("congrats on growth") avoids negative tone. Opens door to technical conversation without hard pitch.

## Prospect 2: Filevine

### Decision-Maker Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Jonas Kratochvil |
| Title | VP of Machine Learning Initiatives |
| Company | Filevine |
| Context | Interviewed about MedChron launch (June 2025) |

**Alternative Contact:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Brianna Connelly |
| Title | VP of Data Science |
| Context | Interviewed about MedChron launch (June 2025) |

**Note:** Original target Jim Blake (CTO & Co-Founder) recently passed away. Targeting ML leadership instead.

**Key Context:**
- MedChron automates 15-20 hrs of manual medical chronology work
- LOIS launched Oct 2025 with citation verification
- Two AI acquisitions in 2025 (Pincites, Parrot)

---

### Message Variant A: Product-Specific (MedChron)

```
Caught the MedChron update — automating medical chronologies from 15-20 hrs is a big deal. We've been working on vision-language approaches for complex documents (tables, images in text). Curious how you're handling multimodal edge cases.
```
**Characters:** 262

---

### Message Variant B: Platform Focus (LOIS)

```
The LOIS citation verification approach is smart — pairing answers with source excerpts. I've been working on similar RAG accuracy patterns. Would be great to compare notes on retrieval optimization. 15 min chat?
```
**Characters:** 222

---

### Message Variant C: Acquisition Integration

```
Saw the Pincites and Parrot acquisitions — integrating multiple AI systems is tricky. We've done similar consolidation work. Happy to share patterns that worked if useful.
```
**Characters:** 179

---

### Recommended: Variant A (to Jonas Kratochvil)

**Why:** References specific product (MedChron) and June 2025 announcement. Positions expertise (vision-language) relevant to their document processing challenge. Opens technical conversation without presuming problems.
