## Prioritize Tier (4.0+)

### #1: Paxton AI — Score: 4.05

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Budget Indicators | 25% | 3 | Series A ($28M total), 24 employees |
| Problem Fit | 25% | 5 | RAG accuracy is core product; CTO gap matches advisory |
| Timing | 20% | 5 | CTO departed June 2025 — urgent need |
| Access | 15% | 3 | CEO LinkedIn public; no warm intro |
| Strategic Value | 15% | 4 | Strong legal AI logo; referral potential |

**Calculation:** (3×0.25) + (5×0.25) + (5×0.20) + (3×0.15) + (4×0.15) = 0.75 + 1.25 + 1.00 + 0.45 + 0.60 = **4.05**

**Why Prioritize:**
- Direct problem-capability match (RAG optimization)
- Time-sensitive opportunity (CTO departure creates window)
- CEO has VC background — understands advisory value
- Faster decision cycle (24-person company)

**Action:** Immediate personalized outreach to Dr. Tanguy Chau (CEO)

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Budget Indicators | 25% | 5 | Series E ($548M), ~500 employees, $3B valuation |
| Problem Fit | 25% | 4 | Vision AI fits MedCron/docs; internal team exists |
| Timing | 20% | 3 | Growth mode, not crisis |
| Access | 15% | 3 | CTO co-founder; harder to reach at scale |
| Strategic Value | 15% | 5 | Unicorn logo, high referral value |

**Calculation:** (5×0.25) + (4×0.25) + (3×0.20) + (3×0.15) + (5×0.15) = 1.25 + 1.00 + 0.60 + 0.45 + 0.75 = **4.05**

**Why Prioritize:**
- Largest budget potential
- Vision document AI directly relevant (MedCron, contracts)
- User complaints about search create pain point
- Strong logo value for portfolio

**Action:** Personalized outreach to Jim Blake (CTO), expect longer cycle

## Priority Ranking

| Priority | Prospect | Score | Timing | Recommended Approach |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **1** | Paxton AI | 4.05 | 5 | Advisory/fractional, RAG optimization |
| **2** | Filevine | 4.05 | 3 | Project-based, vision document AI |

### Ranking Rationale

Both prospects scored identically at 4.05. Paxton AI ranked #1 because:

1. **Higher Timing Urgency (5 vs 3):** CTO departure creates immediate need; window may close when they hire
2. **Faster Decision Cycle:** 24 employees vs 500 — CEO can decide quickly
3. **Lower Competition:** No internal AI team to compete with
4. **Direct Fit:** RAG accuracy is literally their product differentiator

Filevine ranked #2 because:
1. **Higher Budget (5 vs 3):** More financial capacity for larger engagement
2. **Higher Strategic Value (5 vs 4):** Unicorn logo, referral network
3. **Longer Cycle Acceptable:** No urgency means time to build relationship
