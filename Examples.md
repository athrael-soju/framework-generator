#### Analyze

**Prospect Analysis Report: Vultr**

**Competitive Position:**

| Dimension | Vultr | DigitalOcean | Verdict |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Data centers | 32 | 13 | Vultr ahead |
| Tutorial library | ~200 | 8,000+ | Gap |
| Community (Discord) | None | Active | Gap |

| Pricing transparency | High | High | Parity |

**Key Gaps:**
1. Documentation depth (6x fewer tutorials than DigitalOcean)
2. Community infrastructure absent
3. AI messaging strong on hardware, weak on developer experience

**Strategic Priorities (from public signals):**
- AI infrastructure investment (GPU supercluster)
- Developer acquisition (DevRel hiring)
- Competitive differentiation (CMO posts)

**Entry Point:**
- Buyer: CMO (Kevin Cochrane)
- Budget indicator: $333M funding, marketing leadership engaged
- What makes them look good: Developer growth metrics, competitive positioning

**Opportunity Areas:**
1. AI reference architectures and technical content
2. Developer experience benchmarking
3. Community infrastructure design
4. GPU performance validation

---

#### Rank

**Qualification Scorecard:**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Budget Indicators | 25% | 5 | $333M funding, $3.5B valuation |
| Problem Fit | 25% | 5 | AI research + DevRel + content = direct match |
| Timing | 20% | 5 | Active hiring, public AI push, CMO posting |
| Access | 15% | 4 | CMO active on LinkedIn, engaged with content |
| Strategic Value | 15% | 5 | Retainer potential, case study, referrals |

**Total: 4.8 / 5.0**

**Recommendation:** Prioritize — active outreach

---

#### Craft

**Outreach Message:**

> Saw your post about building out Vultr's AI developer experience — and noticed the gap between your GPU infrastructure investment and DigitalOcean's tutorial dominance came up in the comments.
>
> I've been researching this space and found that mid-market cloud providers have a specific window right now: enterprises are frustrated with hyperscaler complexity but need more than raw compute. Vultr's 32 data centers + NVIDIA Elite status is undersold.
>
> I help cloud infra companies translate AI capabilities into developer-facing content and positioning. Would a 20-minute call to share what I'm seeing in this space be useful?

**Supporting Brief:**
- Key gaps: Documentation depth, community infrastructure, AI messaging
- Likely priorities: DevRel buildout, competitive differentiation
- Entry point: CMO owns DevRel and Marketing
- Proposed engagement: Research retainer, $15K/month

**Outcome:** CMO responded, discovery call scheduled, proposal sent, agreement signed.

### IDEAS Execution

#### Identify

**Inputs:**
- Client Contract Agreement (6-month retainer, $15K/month)
- Client Analysis Report (expanded from Prospect Analysis)

**Research Opportunities:**

| Priority | Opportunity | Client Need | Hypothesis |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | AI Reference Architectures | Technical content for DevRel | Production-ready implementations drive adoption |
| 2 | Developer Experience Benchmarking | Competitive positioning | Documentation depth is primary selection factor |
| 3 | Community Infrastructure Design | Scale engagement | Platform choice affects engagement velocity |
| 4 | GPU Performance Validation | Marketing credibility | Third-party benchmarks increase confidence |

**Selected Focus:** AI Reference Architectures + Developer Experience Benchmarking

---

#### Develop

**Hypothesis Document: Documentation Depth**

**Statement:**
```
IF Vultr increases tutorial depth to match DigitalOcean's coverage
THEN developer acquisition from organic search will increase
BECAUSE developers choose platforms where they find implementation guidance
MEASURABLE BY tutorial page traffic, search rankings, time-to-first-deploy
```

**Prior Work:**
- DigitalOcean's 8,000+ tutorial library cited as primary differentiator
- Developer surveys: documentation quality in top 3 selection criteria
- SEO analysis: DigitalOcean ranks for long-tail developer queries

**Feasibility Assessment:**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Data Availability | 5 | Public (competitor docs, SEO tools, reviews) |
| Resources | 5 | Web research, content analysis |
| Timeline | 4 | 3-4 weeks for comprehensive analysis |
| Skill Match | 5 | Content strategy, SEO analysis |
| Client Dependency | 5 | Low (mostly public data) |

**Total: 4.8 / 5.0** — Proceed

**Scope:**
- Compare documentation across 5 competitors
- Analyze SEO performance for 50 key queries
- Survey developers on documentation influence (if client provides access)
- Exclude: Actual content creation (separate workstream)

---

#### Evaluate

**Evidence Collected:**

| Source | Method | Sample |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Documentation audit | Manual review | 5 competitors, 12 dimensions |
| SEO analysis | Tool-based | 50 key developer queries |
| Review sentiment | Text analysis | G2, Reddit, HN — 200+ mentions |
| Developer survey | Client-facilitated | 15 responses |

**Key Findings:**
1. DigitalOcean ranks #1-3 for 78% of queries; Vultr ranks #1-3 for 12%
2. Documentation depth correlation with organic traffic: r=0.73
3. 11/15 surveyed developers cited "finding tutorials" as selection factor
4. Vultr docs rated "functional but sparse" in 60% of reviews

**Verdict:** Supported (High Confidence)
- Multiple evidence types converge
- Effect size meaningful (6x ranking gap)
- Mechanism plausible (tutorials → SEO → discovery → adoption)

**Problem-Fit:** High — directly actionable, clear success metrics

---

#### Articulate

**Deliverable: Developer Experience Strategy Report**

**Executive Summary:**
Vultr's infrastructure investment is undersold due to documentation and community gaps. Closing these gaps is the highest-leverage growth opportunity.

**Key Findings:**
1. Documentation depth is primary developer selection factor
2. 6x search ranking gap vs DigitalOcean
3. Community infrastructure absent vs competitor presence
4. AI positioning strong on hardware, weak on experience

**Recommendations:**

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Expand GPU/AI tutorial coverage | Month 1-2 |
| 2 | Launch developer community (Discord) | Month 2-3 |
| 3 | Content production system (2-3/week) | Month 3-4 |
| 4 | Ambassador program pilot | Month 4-6 |

**Format:** Report + presentation for executive team

---

#### Share

**Delivery:**
- Presentation to CMO + DevRel lead
- Report delivered for reference
- Q&A session, feedback collected

**Feedback:**
- Positive reception on competitive analysis
- Request for deeper dive on community platforms
- Follow-on: Ambassador program design

**Referral Request:** At month 4, requested introductions to peer CMOs.

**Outcome:** Engagement extended, case study approved, two referrals received.
