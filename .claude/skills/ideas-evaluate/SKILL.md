# IDEAS Evaluate Stage

Test claims against evidence.

## Activities

| Activity | Inputs | Outputs |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Data Collection | Data sources, methods | Raw data organized by hypothesis |
| Analysis | Raw data, methods | Results, visualizations |
| Results Interpretation | Results, hypothesis criteria | Support/refute assessment |
| Problem-Fit Check | Findings, original problem | Relevance assessment |
| Quality Assurance | All outputs | QA checklist, documentation |

## Evidence Strength Hierarchy

| Type | Strength | Use For |
|------|----------|---------|
| Quantitative (metrics, benchmarks) | High | Measuring effects, comparisons |
| Qualitative (interviews, reviews) | Medium-High | Understanding mechanisms |
| Secondary research (reports) | Medium | Supporting arguments |
| Expert opinion | Low-Medium | Filling gaps |
| Anecdotal | Low | Illustration only |

## Hypothesis Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Strongly Supported | Multiple evidence types converge, meaningful effect |
| Supported | Evidence favors hypothesis, some limitations |
| Inconclusive | Mixed evidence, cannot determine |
| Not Supported | Evidence contradicts hypothesis |
| Refuted | Strong evidence against |

## Skills to Execute

1. **data_collection** - Collect data per methodology
2. **analysis_execution** - Execute analysis on collected data
3. **evaluate_hypothesis** - Assess evidence against hypothesis
4. **quality_assurance** - QA check on outputs

## Output

Evaluation Report containing:
- Evidence summary per hypothesis
- Verdict with confidence level
- Alternatives considered
- Limitations acknowledged
- Reproducibility documentation

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Collection methods documented
- [ ] Analysis reproducible
- [ ] Alternatives considered
- [ ] Confidence appropriate to evidence
- [ ] Problem-fit assessed
