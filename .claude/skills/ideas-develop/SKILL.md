# IDEAS Develop Stage

Transform opportunities into testable hypotheses.

## Activities

| Activity | Inputs | Outputs |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Prior Work Review | Research opportunity | Literature summary, known gaps |
| Hypothesis Refinement | Initial hypotheses, prior work | Formal hypothesis statements |
| Feasibility Assessment | Hypotheses, constraints | Feasibility scores, risk factors |
| Scope Definition | Feasibility assessment | Research scope document |

## Hypothesis Structure

```
IF [intervention/condition]
THEN [expected outcome]
BECAUSE [mechanism/rationale]
MEASURABLE BY [metric/evidence]
```

## Feasibility Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Questions |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Data Availability | 25% | Can we access needed data? |
| Resource Requirements | 25% | Time, compute, tools available? |
| Timeline Fit | 20% | Completable within engagement? |
| Skill Match | 15% | Requires expertise we have? |
| Client Dependency | 15% | How much depends on client responsiveness? |

## Feasibility Thresholds

| Score | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| 4.0+ | Proceed |
| 3.0-3.9 | Proceed with modifications |
| 2.0-2.9 | Defer or restructure |
| <2.0 | Abandon |

## Skills to Execute

1. **prior_work_review** - Survey existing literature
2. **hypothesis_refinement** - Create formal testable statements
3. **feasibility_assessment** - Score against criteria
4. **scope_definition** - Define included/excluded scope

## Output

Hypothesis Document containing:
- Formal hypothesis statements
- Required evidence types
- Data sources
- Timeline with milestones
- Assumptions and risks

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Hypotheses are falsifiable
- [ ] Required evidence specified
- [ ] Data sources identified and accessible
- [ ] Timeline realistic
- [ ] Assumptions stated
