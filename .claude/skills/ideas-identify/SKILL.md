| Activity | Inputs | Outputs |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Contract Review | Client Contract Agreement | Scope constraints, deliverable requirements |
| Gap Analysis | Client Analysis Report | Gap inventory with severity ratings |
| Opportunity Mapping | Gap inventory, your expertise | Research opportunity list |
| Prioritization | Opportunities, client priorities | Prioritized research agenda |

## Key Questions

| Question | Purpose |
