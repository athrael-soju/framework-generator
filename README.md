# PRAXIS

A complete framework for research consulting: from finding clients to delivering value.

**PRAXIS** = Practice + Axis - the central axis around which your consulting practice operates.

## Methodologies

| Methodology | Purpose | Stages |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **SPARC** | Client acquisition | Signal - Profile - Analyze - Rank - Craft |
| **IDEAS** | Research delivery | Identify - Develop - Evaluate - Articulate - Share |

## Usage

Run SPARC stages for client acquisition:
- `/signal` → `/profile` → `/analyze` → `/rank` → `/craft`

Run IDEAS stages for research delivery:
- `/identify` → `/develop` → `/evaluate` → `/articulate` → `/share`

Each stage requires approval before proceeding to the next.

## Getting Started

Start with [framework/PRAXIS.md](framework/PRAXIS.md) for the complete overview.
